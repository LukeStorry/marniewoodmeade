**Spotlight on 'Supporting Risk'**

---

**So how has your experience been of Bristol so far? You're allowed to say bad things but no swearing…**

I wouldn't dream of it! I think's it been an interesting ride, initially I found it quite difficult, settling in to the city, and feeling like I belonged at the university took a while. I don't know if I'm even really there yet. It's a very different experience to my time at school, I think the university is quite disjointed to the city, initially that made me feel quite confused. Now I feel like I'm at home here, I've made friends, I've made connections with people that get me and I feel settled in my department at university. I feel like I have a community here and I love it. Sorry I'm not sure that was very cohesive!

**No that was a lovely answer! You said the university feels quite disjointed from the city, why did you feel that way initially? Do you still feel that way now?**

I definitely do still feel that way. I think it's symptomatic of the city as a whole, I think Clifton, Redland, the city centre, I think the parts of the city that the university buildings are in are disjointed from the city. It's really easy to feel like the triangle, Clifton and Eat-a-Pita, are the only things that exist in Bristol. No shade I promise! But there's so much more to the city, there's so much history, there's so much culture and there's so much going on. It's so easy to get stuck in the uni bubble, and although it's not a campus uni, it feels like a campus. You have to actively break out of that bubble or you're going to spend your whole time here not knowing even ten percent of the story. So I didn't feel like I had a place within that uni bubble initially, finding that there were other spaces outside of that bubble really helped.

**How did you find those other spaces?**

I think to some extent I just stumbled upon things. I think every now and then they'll be opportunities that crop up in university that kind of draw you out and bring you to see that there are other things. Yeah, I think also through the community I also had at my place of worship. That made me feel I had a connection to the city, because it was a community completely outside of the university.

**So this year you started AfroLit society, what does that stand for and why did you decide to start it?**

So AfroLit is the African Literature society, the idea is that it's a place that you can learn about, engage with and talk about literature produced by people of African descent. It's essentially a book club. But I also want it to be a portal through which people can find opportunities, events and things to do with arts and culture produced by black people in this city. I started it because I always loved reading, but I'd not always read books by African authors, I'd just not done it. It's not really something that is encouraged in school when you do English literature, the books I was presented with were all very specific white European authors, I wanted to widen my scope. Literary palate is the word I'm trying to avoid, it's low-key pretentious! But yeah, that's what I want to say. I think it's important because I'd like to consider myself well-read but if you don't read widely then you can't be well-read.

This is particularly close to my heart because I'm Nigerian, so reading books by people that I can relate to more directly helps a lot with learning about myself. Literature is a great way to learn about yourself, to learn about others. That's also kind of the point, you don't have to be Nigerian to read Nigerian literature, you don't have to be from the places that these authors are from or have been through the same experiences to appreciate it. In the same way that I didn't live in Victorian Britain, but I can still read Dickens and appreciate it, because it speaks to something deeper than who we are on the surface, I think it's about who we are as people. I wanted it to be just a chance for people to learn more about something I'm passionate about.

**Do you feel like starting up a literature society was a risk?**

Yeah, definitely! I do. I first had the idea for it in 2017 when I read <a href="https://www.chimamanda.com/book/half-of-a-yellow-sun/">'Half of a Yellow Sun' by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie</a>‎ and I wanted to start this, but I was way too scared to do it. I didn't think I was up for it. I didn't know if anyone else would want to have me, or if anyone would care or anyone would want to be involved. I don't like doing things that fail. I'm 'allergic' to failure, unfortunately for me, even though I do fail a lot. It's really funny, I was at an assessment centre for a TeachFirst internship and two people I met there asked if I was involved in any societies. I told them I about the societies I was already involved in, but I had an idea for a society and they told me that I had to go for it. I just felt like these two people who don't go to my uni, who don't know anything about me are telling me to go for it. What is the worst thing that can happen? The worst thing is that it fails and that's okay. So, I'm glad, because I was so close to not doing it.

**Do you feel like the university encourages or supports you to take those kinds of risks?**

I think to an extent yes, the whole point of university is learning and discovery, of yourself, of your subject, of politics, of arts. I feel like it does foster an environment where you are allowed to and encouraged to try new things. So far, I do feel like I've had a lot of support. I guess it depends on what kind of risks you're taking, in AfroLit people have supported me way more than I thought they would, people have shown way more interest than I thought they would. I wouldn't be here without the support of people. I think people appreciate it when you take risks at university and they want things to work for you, especially if they care. So yeah, I think you are supported in taking risks here.

**That's _actually really_ encouraging to here, it's interesting talking to people, when it comes to academia some of the students I've spoken to felt really nervous about taking risks. They feel such intense pressure to do well. So, taking any sort of risk becomes a big dangerous deal, but it's nice to know that there are areas where students feel really supported. What are your aspirations this year for yourself and the society?**

I want to be able to balance it alongside my degree, I don't want to let it overrun my studies. For the society my only aspiration is that people who are involved in it enjoy it and feel like it's worthwhile. Because I started it for myself because I wanted to join a society like this, but it's not about me. I want to create a space where people can come and learn, no judgement, you don't have to know anything. I don't know that much, so you can know literally nothing, you don't even have to have read a book in the last three years but I want the people that come to our events to feel like their opinions are still valued and feel like they've learnt something or enjoyed something. In that sense that's my only real aspiration for the society. But I'd love to be able to pass it on, that I've created something that can be sustainable.
