**Have you ever attended an event and just thought ‘I wish
more people were here to hear this’? That is exactly how I felt all afternoon
whilst attending the second Employability Exchange event on Wednesday
afternoon.**

I didn’t know much about the event before attending,
other than that there was a free lunch (I was sold) and there was a focus on
authentic learning – something I passionately feel we should be exploring more
in the curriculum. Regardless of my lack of knowledge on what would take place,
I was looking forward to the afternoon in Engineers’ House.

And I was not disappointed. From Tansy’s energetic
introduction to her vision for education at Bristol and the new Bristol Futures
Curriculum Framework (more on this at a later date) to the quick-fire
contributions from colleagues implementing authentic learning in their
programmes, the four-hours were pack with inspiration and enthusiasm for
embedding employability authentically in the curriculum.

We were lucky to have Dr Kate Daubney, Head of Careers and Employability at Kings College London, join us, where she shared their ‘Employability Touchstone’ approach to embedding employability. Their focus is not on adding employability into an already packed curriculum but rather looking at what is already covered and highlighting where tasks, activities and content enhance students’ employability. It isn’t about fitting something new in, it’s about taking what is already there and enhancing it – you can read more about this in <a href="https://uob.sharepoint.com/:p:/r/teams/grp-epa/Shared%20Documents/Events/Employability%20Exchanges/Employability%20Exchange%20November%202019/3.%20%23EE2%20slides%20(Kate_Daubney).pptx">Kate’s slides</a>.

Kate’s talk was followed by a panel discussion with Tansy, Kate and BILT Student Fellow Marnie Woodmeade and SU Undergraduate Education Officer Hillary Gyebi-Ababio. They shared how they believe authentic learning could support both students learning experience and wellbeing, and the impact it could have on their future careers.

We then had six very quick presentations from colleagues
(four listed below) on their use and experience of authentic learning, ending
with a 50-slide, 5-minute presentation from James, in which he whizzed though
his journey in ‘The Office’ at a rate of six seconds per slide! I don’t want to
make any promises, but rumour on the street is that we may be getting a
recorded version of it to share with those who couldn’t be there… watch this
space!

Some time was then spent in Faculty groups discussing
next steps for exploring this further and each of the FEDs (plus a SED!) fed
back to the group. The only questions I left with was how to share the day’s
events with more people – and so here we are.

The day was jointly hosted by the Careers Service and BILT. Stuart Johnson, Director of Careers, has shared his thoughts:

<blockquote>We’re delighted to have hosted such a positive and well-received event. The presentations and discussions demonstrated how employability already is an authentic part of some curricula, and how creatively it can be explored as part of the overall student education experience. We look forward to continuing to work with BILT to surface and share activity, and to working in partnership with Schools to ensure every programme authentically embeds employability and that students recognise the associated benefits of what they’re learning.</blockquote>
