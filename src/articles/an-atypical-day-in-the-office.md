##### Amy's reflection:

I'd been looking forward to visiting James' 'Just Timber' office since before the concept had even come to fruition. Last year, while catching up over coffee, James told me about his plan to turn on one his classrooms into an office, and
I was instantly excited. The project was a combination of all my favourite
pedagogies: active learning, blended learning, challenge-led learning,
authentic learning, group work… all coming together to form the 'Just Timber'
office in 1.32 Queens Building.

'Just Timber' is a fictional engineering company James has created. His students (employees) were all set timber engineering design projects at the beginning of the unit and are working together to create real designs with real equations in an almost real-world environment. If you want to read more about the project so far, I highly recommend reading <a href="https://bilt.online/?s=the+office+&amp;orderby=relevance&amp;order=DESC">'The Office' blog series </a>.

A date was set in the diary to visit, and I invited two of our Student Fellows to come along and join me. And so, last Thursday, we went along and waited for James to
show up fifteen minutes late to our visit after almost forgetting we were
coming – helping further imitate the real-world, authentic environment (just
kidding) and heighten our anticipation further.

And, when we arrived, we were not disappointed. We were welcomed by an offer of tea or coffee (served in a 'Just Timber' mug, of course) and then proceeded to look around the office and take it all in.

The first thing I was struck by was the buzz in the room. Not a noisy, can't-do-any-work' buzz, but the natural up-and-down of a genuine office environment, with students in their groups switching between their sketching, calculations and
discussions with each other over how best to proceed in their projects. Barely
a glance was thrown in our direction when we bumbled into the room, the
students so engaged in their projects that they weren't looking for
distraction.

We had a quick look around the office, admiring the various projects pinned on the wall, and browsing the elegant engineering magazines by the break-out space. We then proceeded to interrupt students by asking them questions about how they were
finding the unit and how it compared to others they were taking.

As you can imagine, they loved it. Of course, they are students, and so the conversations were not void of the odd grumble (nothing you wouldn't expect from a unit being run for the first time), but the overwhelming response was that they looked
forward to Thursdays – regardless of the fact they were spending eight hours in
the office – and that the learning they were doing there was both enjoyable,
challenging and reflective of an authentic engineering office environment. Some
of the students even ended the day with a traditional post-work trip to the
pub, further preparing them for life out working in the 'real world'.

If you've been keeping up with The Office blog series, you'll know that students prepare for their day's work by watching videos James has created on their VLE, and then come to work to study their projects. This means that time in class/ office is
dedicated purely to student-centred work with no didactic teaching. Students
highlighted that their favourite aspects of the unit were the group work
element, the room layout (large groupings of desks together), the
project-centred work and the fact that they had a day dedicated to the unit.
Student wouldn't want <em>all</em> of their modules to run as full-day units, however, but would have found a unit like this in their previous years of study valuable and enjoyable and a great chance to get to know others in their
cohort.

James' Just Timber office is a product of a great idea, hard work and dedication to a new way of learning, and there are many lessons we can take away from designing
a unit in this way. Please get in touch with BILT if you'd like to learn more
about setting up a project similar to this in your unit.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

##### Marnie's reflection:

I had an extremely positive outlook on the Office before I even entered the building; the concept reflected the challenge-led work that I only ever dreamed about during my undergrad. My
positivity was only enhanced by the almost immediate offer of cake and tea (an
important part of daily office life).&nbsp;&nbsp;

However, two pieces of feedback from students struck me as unexpected. The first was that students said they genuinely enjoyed being in the Office. Not merely that it was a great
educational experience, but they actually looked forward to coming in each day.
Having an open-plan office where interaction is encouraged clearly enabled
students to really enjoy their time there.&nbsp;

The other piece of feedback was perhaps more sobering. One student pointed out that although they enjoyed the way the office replicates an engineering company, a 'real boss' is unlikely to give
mass amounts of work on the same day that five of your other supervisors have
given you a deadline. In order for more projects like the Office to succeed,
students felt that communication between units is key. This not only has the
benefit of reducing their stress but treating students as valued workers
positively impacts their outlook on university.&nbsp;&nbsp;

##### Toby's reflection:

One of the things that really struck me about the atmosphere in the Just Timber office (other than the delicious smell of cake courtesy of James' wife and son) was how much it reminded me of a classroom. Not a school classroom – there wasn't any paper being thrown around and James hadn't sent me out to think about how my behaviour affects the rest of the class – but a calmer and more focused 6th Form classroom. And to me that's a real positive. All of the 'employees' were clearly getting work done and you could tell there was a strong sense of purpose. But at the same time, they were relaxed and there was friendliness between them, and the noise of conversation was a world away from the awkward silence of lectures or the hyperactive buzz of a library in exam time.&nbsp;

However, I wasn't there to drink in the atmosphere and reminisce about college. The students seemed more than happy to talk to us about the unit, and I think that was in part due to how much they enjoyed it. It was clear that the effort James had put into it had had an effect on them and their attitudes, but it had paid off in producing a rewarding learning experience.&nbsp;

One area that students weren't unanimous on was the intense one-day-a-week schedule. Some felt more productive, others exhausted (there was a suggestion that maybe in the future
it could not be the day after sports night). However, one interesting element
to me was the effect on wellbeing. With so many units and assignments to
contend with at once it's very easy to get overwhelmed as a student. Containing
the work within a single 9-5 day helps to compartmentalise and means there's
one less thing to worry about for the rest of the week. Instead, something to
look forward to every Thursday.
