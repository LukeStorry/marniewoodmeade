#   Authentic Learning Definition:
#     The key aspect of authentic learning is that it involves real problems, or replicas of real problems. This does not necessarily mean that it has to be outside of university or academia, rather that it involves creating value for a stakeholder. This value creation does not have to be the end product, it can also be through the process that students use. Students have to know how the work they are doing is valuable, and how it could apply to a variety of situations.    Authentic learning should be assessed with an open-ended questions in which students use a variety of skills and metacognition in order to solve an issue. It should also require a community of learners as students create social discourse to work on a project.
